# Installing Wordpress on IBM Cloud with NGINX, SSL and the ability to scale (low cost method)

There are two ways to install this on IBM Cloud.

1. Using Classic infrastructure [here](https://github.com/tim-minter/wordpress-on-ibm-cloud/blob/main/on-classic-infrastructure.md)
2. Using Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure (recommended) [here](https://github.com/tim-minter/wordpress-on-ibm-cloud/blob/main/on-virtual-private-cloud-infrastructure.md)

The second option is recommended but I'm still working on these intructions as of 28/5/21. Currently they work but I havn't ironed out how to to connect into the wordpress instance via the load balancer.
